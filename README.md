## Running the controller in a cluster

The controller can be deployed to a cluster provided you are logged in with cluster-admin credentials:

```bash
export IMG=johncollier/registry-operator:v0.0.1
make install && make deploy
```

## Development

The repository contains a Makefile; building and deploying can be configured via the environment variables

|variable|purpose|default value|
|---|---|---|
| `IMG` | Image used for controller | `quay.io/devfile/registry-operator:next` |

Some of the rules supported by the makefile:

|rule|purpose|
|---|---|
| docker-build | build registry operator docker image |
| docker-push | push registry operator docker image |
| deploy | deploy operator to cluster |
| install | create the devfile registry CRDs on the cluster |
| uninstall | remove the devfile registry operator and CRDs from the cluster |
| manifests | Generate manifests e.g. CRD, RBAC etc. |
| generate | Generate the API type definitions. Must be run after modifying the DevfileRegistry type. |
| test_integration | Run the integration tests for the operator. |

To see all rules supported by the makefile, run `make help`

## Testing

To run integration tests for the operator, run `make test_integration`. 

By default, the tests will use the default image for the operator, `quay.io/devfile/registry-operator:next`. To use your own image, run:

```
export IMG=<your-operator-image>
make test_integration
```

### Run operator locally
It's possible to run an instance of the operator locally while communicating with a cluster. 

```bash
export NAMESPACE=devfileregistry-operator
make run ENABLE_WEBHOOKS=false
```
